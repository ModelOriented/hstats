\description{
Friedman and Popescu's \eqn{H^2_j} statistics of overall interaction strength per
feature, ideally calculated from the result of \code{\link[=interact]{interact()}}.
}
\details{
The logic of Friedman and Popescu (2008) is as follows:
If there are no interactions involving feature \eqn{x_j}, we can decompose the
(centered) prediction function \eqn{F} into the sum of the (centered) partial
dependence \eqn{F_j} on \eqn{x_j} and the (centered) partial dependence
\eqn{F_{\setminus j}} on all other features \eqn{\mathbf{x}_{\setminus j}}, i.e.,
\deqn{
  F(\mathbf{x}) = F_j(x_j) + F_{\setminus j}(\mathbf{x}_{\setminus j}).
}
Correspondingly, Friedman and Popescu's \eqn{H^2_j} statistic of overall interaction
strength is given by
\deqn{
  H_{j}^2 = \frac{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n\big[F(\mathbf{x}_i) - 
  \hat F_j(x_{ij}) - \hat F_{\setminus j}(\mathbf{x}_{i\setminus k})
  \big]^2}{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n\big[F(\mathbf{x}_i)\big]^2}
}
(check \code{\link[=pd]{pd()}} for all definitions).

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{H2_j(default)}: Default method of overall interaction strength.

\item \code{H2_j(interact)}: Overall interaction strength from "interact" object.

}}
\section{Remarks}{

\enumerate{
\item Partial dependence functions (and \eqn{F}) are all centered to (possibly weighted) mean 0.
\item Partial dependence functions (and \eqn{F}) are evaluated over the data distribution.
This is different to partial dependence plots, where one uses a fixed grid.
\item Weighted versions follow by replacing all arithmetic means by corresponding
weighted means.
\item Multivariate predictions can be treated in a component-wise manner.
\item \eqn{H^2_j = 0} means there are no interactions associated with \eqn{x_j}.
The higher the value, the more prediction variability comes from interactions
with \eqn{x_j}.
\item Since the denominator is the same for all features, the values of the test
statistics can be compared across features.

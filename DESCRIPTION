Description: Fast, model-agnostic implementation of the partial dependence
    based interaction statistics of Friedman, J.H. and Popescu, B.E.
    (2008) <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148>. These statistics allow to quantify
    interaction strength per feature, feature pair, and feature triple.
    The package supports multivariate predictions and can deal with case
    weights.  Furthermore, different variants of the original statistics
    are provided.  The shape of the interactions can be investigated by
    partial dependence plots, or individual conditional expectation plots.

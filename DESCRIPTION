Description: Fast, model-agnostic implementation of Friedman and Popescu's
    H statistics of interaction strength <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148>.  These
    statistics quantify interaction strength per feature, feature pair,
    and feature triple.  The package supports multi-output predictions and
    can account for case weights.  In addition, several variants of the
    original statistics are provided.  The shape of the interactions can
    be explored through partial dependence plots or individual conditional
    expectation plots. DALEX explainers, meta learners (mlr3, tidymodels,
    caret) and most other models work out-of-the-box.

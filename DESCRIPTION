Description: Fast, model-agnostic implementation of interaction strength
    statistics introduced in Friedman, J.H. and Popescu, B.E. (2008)
    <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148>.  The package supports multivariate
    predictions and can deal with case weights.  Furthermore, different
    variants of the original statistics are provided.  The shape of the
    interactions can be investigated by stratified or two-dimensional
    partial dependence plots.
